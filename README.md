# What is this project about?

This project is not affiliated with [CrossMixOS](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS). It is just me, writing down
findings, tips and a silly tutorial here and there.

I use [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) as my regular [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) and all remarks and
instructions here are for Linux users.
